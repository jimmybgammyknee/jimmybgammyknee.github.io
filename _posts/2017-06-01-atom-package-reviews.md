Given the amount of brain-space that I reserve to remembering all of the players from [the 1992 West Coast Eagles premiership team](http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/history/1992-premiership-team) and obscure Simpsons references, from the title of this post I think I'm forgiven from sharing this classic:

But I digress....

If you're working in Bioinformatics you need to really love your text editor, because its a tool that you use every day to write scripts, research papers and notes. Because I'm a dinosaur and primarily use bash for most of my work, I have traditionally used [Vim](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net) for most of my programming. However, considering I often find myself working away from the command-line, I have started to use an actual editor.

One such editor, the [hackable text editor "Atom"](https://atom.io), is a massive favourite my mine and my [MSc student Ning "Lucas" Liu](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/bioinformatics-hub/about/students). It's very customisable, is developed/maintained by the github guys and is free! So in this post, we're going to review our top 5 favourite packages for Atom

# Jimmy

## 1\. [Spell-check](https://github.com/atom/spell-check)

Ok it's a standard across most word processing software, but it's crucial for my ridiculously poor spelling. Also allows you to easily switch locale's instead of editing Australian/UK english to US e.g. "colour" to "color" (_shudder_)

## 2\. [Beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)

Was late to the party on this one, but can make your boring looking code look colourful

## 3\. [Markdown Plus](https://github.com/tylingsoft/markdown-plus)

I write a lot of my notes and documents in either markdown to latex, and so having WYSISYG style rendering within the window is always a handy feature.

## 4\. Git integration

While I've always coded in isolation, recently I have starting using [github](https://github.com) and [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) to collaborate more with other Bioinformaticians. Atom has a few cool packages that make working with github easier, such as [git-plus](https://github.com/tkrajina/git-plus) with git-multi and git-recent functions and key-binding options. The git-diff options with [split-diff](https://atom.io/packages/split-diff) is super handy too

## 5\. To Do Lists with [todo-show](https://github.com/mrodalgaard/atom-todo-show)

I've got a shocking memory and so I've got to be extremely vigilate with note writing and comments in my code. I generally like using [Things on mac](https://culturedcode.com/things) but if I'm doing things in Atom I can now get all my to-dos in one place.

## 1\. Programming language auto-detected

It's inevitable that the perfect tools for your work just need slight lil changes. Atom is really handy for its auto-detect-language ability no matter the scripts are in Python, R, bash (shell), C++, Java, GO or other any other programming languages.

## 2\. Autocomplete with [autocomplete-python](https://github.com/autocomplete-python/autocomplete-python)

As a pre-[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) user and because I mostly handle data using Python, I wasn't able to use Atom until I installed this package. And I believe no one can resist a "TAB complete" function.

## 3\. File icons with [file-icon](https://github.com/file-icons/atom)

This hack give distinct icons to files so that you can clearly recognize the files you want to edit. I usually have tons of files with similar names (XXX_ver1.py) in a single directory and they can be super confusing.

## 4\. Highlight with [highlight-selected](https://github.com/richrace/highlight-selected)

One of the most lovable features of [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), which I thought would be lost when moving to Atom. It is just so important when changing variable names in multiple places.

## 5\. Ask questions with [ask-stack](https://github.com/Chris911/Ask-Stack-Atom)

As a noob in Bioinformatics, I need to ask questions constantly. This hack allows you to easily ask questions in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) with a simple `Ctrl + Alt + A`, and browse the questions and answers without open your web browsers (Firefox is seriously eating my RAM)!
