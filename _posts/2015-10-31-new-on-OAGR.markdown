<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter some personal travel commitments and technical issues, I've now been able to update the <a href="https://www.oagr.org.au"> Online Ancient Genome Repository (OAGR)</a> with some new genomes. Over the next few weeks we should be adding a few more, as the ancient DNA community continues to publish some new ancient human and microbiome data.</p> 

The brand new genome is a <a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/09/02/molbev.msv181"> 7,400 year old Mediterranean Cardial individual (CB13) from Cova Bonica in Vallirana (Barcelona).</a> The genome was produced in a study led by Carles Lalueza-Fox's group at the <a href="http://www.ibe.upf-csic.es">Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC-Universitat Pompeu Fabra)</a> Barcelona, Spain. As always you are now free to access all the raw, processed and analysed data by visiting the <a href="https://www.oagr.org.au/public_data"> study section of OAGR</a>

We're still interested in getting more genomes in, so if you're an ancient DNA researcher and would like to have your genome in the repository,
<a href="mailto:jimmy.breen@adelaide.edu.au">please contact me</a> or new ancient human genomics postdoc <a
