Whether it's just me or a trait of most scientists, I get super excited by working with new people who work in an area of science which is outside my area of expertise. 
I have generally had a major issue saying "no" to people, so as a consequence I have been involved with all sorts of weird and wonderful projects, some of which has been successful and others which have not.
Regardless of the success of the project, I always retain the amazing connections to my collaborators on each project, as well as the skills that I learnt along the way.

One particular "out-of-left-field" type project that I've been a part of has been a collaboration with a talented artist called [Helen Pynor](http://www.helenpynor.com/index.htm).
We initially started working together for an Art/Science residency at the South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) in 2019, which was generoursly funded by [Australian Network for Art and Technology (ANAT)](https://www.anat.org.au).
The work that came out of the project, called '93% Human', has been enormously successful and been shown in Art Galleries and Exhibitions across the world, including Brisbane, Dubbo, Karlsruhe (Germany) and Stockholm (Sweden).
