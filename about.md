<p class="intro">My name is Jimmy Breen and I'm the Bioinformatics Core manager for the <a href="https://www.sahmri.org/">South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute</a> here in Adelaide, South Australia.
I have a few other roles as well, firstly as a team leader in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/robinson-research-institute/"> the Robinson Research Institute</a>, as well as being a member of the University of Adelaide's Bioinformatics Hub.
Professionally, I'm interested in Genomics, Bioinformatics and Data Science, and I have a background in Plant Genomics, Ancient DNA and Next Generation Sequencing Technologies.
Personally, I'm into sport, food, craft beer, data analytics and hanging with my family.
This blog is a collection of scientific ideas, thoughts and interesting topics covered by myself (in my work or personal life) or from my brilliant Bioinformatics co-workers or students.
