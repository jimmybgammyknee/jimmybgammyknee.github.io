<p class="intro">My name is Jimmy Breen and I'm the Bioinformatics core-facility manager for <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/robinson-research-institute/">the Robinson Research Institute</a> & member of the University of Adelaide's Bioinformatics Hub. Professionally, I'm interested in Genomics, Bioinformatics and Data Science, and I have a background in Plant Genomics and Next Generation Sequencing Technologies. Personally, I'm into sport, food, craft beer, data analytics and hanging with my family.
