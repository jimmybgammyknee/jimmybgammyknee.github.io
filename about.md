<p class="intro">My name is Jimmy Breen and I'm the Bioinformatics Core Team Leader for the <a href="https://www.sahmri.org/">South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute</a> here in Adelaide, South Australia.
I have a few other roles as well, firstly as a Team Leader in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/robinson-research-institute/">the Robinson Research Institute</a>, and a member of the <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/bioinformatics-hub/">University of Adelaide's Bioinformatics Hub</a>.
I'm interested in everything associated with Genomics, Bioinformatics and Data Science.
I have a background in Plant Genomics, Ancient DNA and Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies, and have worked across Australia and in Europe for academic and commercial institutions.
Personally, I'm a lover of many sports (mostly Australian Rules Football), BBQ, craft beer, wine and hanging with my family.
This blog is a collection of scientific ideas, thoughts and interesting topics covered by myself (in my work or personal life) or from my brilliant Bioinformatics co-workers and students.
